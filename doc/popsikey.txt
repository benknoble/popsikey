INTRO                                                         *popsikey-intro*

If you have lots of vim mappings that relate to the same subject, you may have
"namespaced" them by using a prefix.

As an example, suppose all of your git mappings start with `<leader>g`:
    - `<leader>gg` is |:Gstatus|
    - `<leader>gc` is |:Gcommit|

popsikey provides an interface to automatically turn those mappings into a popup
menu when it's supported. With our example mappings, you would create this by
doing >
    call popsikey#register('<leader>g', [
            \ #{key: 'g', info: 'status', action: ":Gstatus\<CR>", flags: 'n'},
            \ #{key: 'c', info: 'commit', action: ":Gcommit\<CR>", flags: 'n'},
            \ ],
            \ {})
<
So, `<leader>g` pops up the menu of git mappings, which is a list of map keys
and descriptions. You navigate with the usual keys (|j|, |k|, <Esc>, <Enter>).
But your mappings work--so  pressing `g` inside the popup will trigger
|:Gstatus| as a shortcut to navigating the menu.

And, if your vim doesn't support popups yet, you'll get regular old mappings:
>
    nnoremap <leader>gg :Gstatus<CR>
    nnoremap <leader>gc :Gcommit<CR>
<
That means the experience is seamless everywhere.

USAGE                                                         *popsikey-usage*

Install it with your favorite plugin manager and then take advantage of the
capabilities described in |popsikey-functions|.

==============================================================================

FUNCTIONS                                                  *popsikey-functions*

                                                           *popsikey#register*
popsikey#register({prefix}, {maps}, {opts})
                Register a set of prefixed normal-mode mappings under
                `prefix`. The mappings are described by `maps`, a list of
                dictionaries with the keys
                    - `key`: the key on which to trigger the mapping (without
                      the prefix)
                    - `info`: a short description of the action for this
                      mapping; this can be a |Funcref| returning a string for
                      dynamic descriptions; the item will be skipped if it
                      returns an empty string.
                    - `action`: the action to take (|popsikey-action|)
                    - `flags`: a string of |feedkeys()| flags. If `flags`
                      would cause keys not be mapped by |feedkeys()| and
                      popups are unavailable, the created mappings are
                      non-recursive. Otherwise, the mappings are recursive.
                      Default: 'n'

                With |+popupwin|, `opts` will be fed to |popup_create| when
                the popup is triggered (see also |popup_create-arguments|).
                Merged with a default containing >
                    #{
                    \ filter: 'popsikey#filter',
                    \ callback: 'popsikey#callback',
                    \ title: prefix,
                    \ padding: [1,2,1,2],
                    \ pos: 'topleft',
                    \ line: 'cursor+1',
                    \ col: 'cursor',
                    \ }
<
		WARNING: do not override filter or callback; doing so will
		break the menu's key-handler.

                Without |+popupwin|, `opts` is ignored.

                With |+popupwin|, the prefix key triggers a popup-menu. You
                navigate it with |j| and |k|. <Esc> will quit. <Enter> or <CR>
                accepts the item under the cursor, triggering its action.
                Pressing a key in (as defined in `maps`) will also trigger the
                associated action. `maps` can use |j|, |k|, and the other
                navigation keys as triggers, but you lose the ability to move
                around in the popup.

                Without |+popupwin|, normal-mode mappings are created that
                mimic the popup (without flashing the popup). So `prefix`
                followed by a `key` (from `maps`) will still work. The value
                of `flags` determines whether or not the mapping is recursive.

                Note that, with or without |+popupwin|, only global
                normal-mode mappings are supported at this time. Also, no
                |<expr>| or other modifiers on mappings are supported.

                Returns an id suitable for |popsikey#extend|.

                                                             *popsikey#extend*
popsikey#extend({id}, {maps}, {opts})
                Extends the mappings/menu defined by `id` (the return value of
                |popsikey#register|, also viewable in `g:popsikey`). Done by
                calling |extend()| with the "force" method.

                This function can be used to define a base-set of mappings on
                the menu, and then add to it with custom logic later on, if
                you save the id returned on registration.

                With |+popupwin|, the `maps` are added to the popup.

                Without |+popupwin|, the normal-mode mappings are extended.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                             *popsikey-action*

Popsikey actions currently take one of three forms:

- string (`type(action) is# v:t_string`)

    With |+popupwin|, this will be fed to |feedkeys| when the item is
    selected, so you may need double-quotes and backslash-escapes on special
    characters like <CR>.

    Without |+popupwin|, the action string is passed to |:execute|, which runs
    a |:map| command (and should be compatible with |feedkeys|), so there is
    a fair bit of string-escaping and interpreting going on. I advise sticking
    to normal-mode key-strokes or function calls where possible. The <bar>
    literal (`|`) will be escaped automatically in this mode, as it works for
    |feedkeys| but not |:execute|.

- no value (or `type(action) is# v:none`)

    The prefix key and key for the selected item will fed through
    |feedkeys()|.

- id (`type(action) is# v:t_number`)

    With |+popupwin| this creates a "sub-popup"---that is, pressing the key
    for the corresponding action will close the current popup and open the one
    corresponding to `id`.

    Without |+popupwin|, the items from the group corresponding to `id` are
    added as mappings prefixed with the current prefix (not the prefix
    they were originally defined with).
